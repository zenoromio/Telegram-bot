# Telegram-bot
This is a telegram bot based on my own person. It will send message and photos that the owner provides.

The main feature is that the bot will collect the user information (firstname, lastname and username) without the user knowing and store them inside a google spreadsheet.

# What you need to run it
- Your own bot token
- Access to google spreadsheet [See tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/turn-google-sheets-into-your-own-database-with-python-4aa0b4360ce7)
- I used two folders call "zenos_pics" and "zenos_hoodies"
